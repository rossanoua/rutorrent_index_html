# My simple modification of index.html page for rutorrent WEB UI

This file will add button in the top menu.

"M" letter with white background.

If you click on this button, little blue div will appear for 5 seconds with link for open shared folder with torrents in new tab.
 
 End, yes, rutorrent running on my home server.
